# React-Employee-Directory
User Story 
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

Business Context 
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

Acceptance Criteria 
Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. The user should be able to:
Sort the table by at least one category 
Filter the users by at least one property.

Note: the buttons still need to be linked to sort the cards.
